## Abstract
The research paper aims to establish the application of Big Data in the analysis, interpretation, and storage of medical records in the healthcare system. Big Data is used in the analysis of healthcare informatics, which consists of complex data sets that are hard to store, resolve, organize, process, and interpret. The benefits obtained from the application of Big Data in the healthcare system include reduced costs incurred in the delivery of healthcare services, optimal management of information, prevention of the side effects of drugs on patients, the discovery of treatments for incurable diseases, and improved service delivery. The challenges faced in the use of Big Data in the healthcare system include problems with analyzing unstructured data, focusing on correlations rather than casualty, privacy issues which act as barriers in the collection of information, data security due to hacking, and reluctance by health care centers to share patient data due to competition.
